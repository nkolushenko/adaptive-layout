Adaptive Layout for Unity

A Unity UI scaling solution that ensures consistent physical size of UI elements across different devices.

ðŸ“– Overview

This package solves the problem of inconsistent UI sizes on different screens by dynamically adjusting the CanvasScaler based on the device's actual screen density (DPI) rather than just resolution.

ðŸ›‘ The Issue:
By default, Unityâ€™s CanvasScaler scales UI elements based on screen resolution, not physical size. This means:

A button may appear larger on a low-resolution tablet than on a high-resolution phone.
UI elements can feel too big or too small depending on the device's DPI.

âœ… Key Features

Maintains a consistent physical size of UI elements across different screens.

Uses native APIs for precise screen scaling (UIScreen.mainScreen.nativeScale on iOS and DisplayMetrics on Android).

Supports both high-DPI and low-DPI devices for a uniform user experience.

Standalone-friendly â€“ does not require DI (but can be adapted for DI frameworks).

Lightweight & optimized â€“ minimal performance overhead.
