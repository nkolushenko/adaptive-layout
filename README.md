Adaptive Layout for Unity  

A Unity UI scaling solution that ensures a consistent physical size of UI elements across different devices.  

ðŸ“– Overview  

This package solves the problem of inconsistent UI sizes across screens by dynamically adjusting the CanvasScaler based on the device's actual screen density (DPI) rather than just resolution.  

ðŸ›‘ The Problem  
By default, Unityâ€™s CanvasScaler scales UI elements based on screen resolution, not physical size. This leads to:  

Buttons appearing larger on low-resolution tablets than on high-resolution phones.  
UI elements feeling too big or too small depending on the device's DPI and screen scale factor.  

âœ… Key Features  
âœ” Maintains a consistent physical size of UI elements across different screens.  
âœ” Uses native APIs for precise screen scaling (UIScreen.mainScreen.nativeScale on iOS and DisplayMetrics on Android).  
âœ” Supports both high-DPI and low-DPI devices for a uniform user experience.  
âœ” Standalone-friendly â€“ does not require DI (but can be adapted for DI frameworks like Zenject).  
âœ” Lightweight & optimized â€“ minimal performance overhead.
